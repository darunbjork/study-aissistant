I have updated the navbar color for better aesthetics and readability in both light and dark modes.

<br>

Here is a summary of the changes:

<br>

- Modified `Navbar.css` to use a lighter gray for the navbar background and darker text in light mode.
- Added dark mode specific styles for the navbar background and text to ensure good contrast.

<br>
I will now commit the changes.
